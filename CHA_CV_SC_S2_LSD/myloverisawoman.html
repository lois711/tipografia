<h3>I.</h3>
<p>

my lover is a woman
and when i hold her
feel her warmth
     i feel good
     feel safe
     </p>

<p>then—i never think of
my family’s voices
never hear my sisters say
bulldaggers, queers, funny
     come see us, but don’t
     bring your friends
          it’s ok with us,
          but don’t tell mama
          it’d break her heart
never feel my father
turn in his grave
never hear my mother cry
Lord, what kind of child is this?</p>

 

<h3>II.</h3>


<p>my lover’s hair is blonde
and when it rubs across my face
it feels soft
     feels like a thousand fingers
     touch my skin and hold me
          and i feel good

then—i never think of the little boy
who spat and called me nigger
never think of the policemen
who kicked my body and said crawl
never think of Black bodies
hanging in trees or filled
with bullet holes
never hear my sisters say
white folks hair stinks
don’t trust any of them
never feel my father
turn in his grave
never hear my mother talk
of her backache after scrubbing floors
never hear her cry
Lord, what kind of child is this?</p>

 

<h3>III. </h3>

<p>my lover’s eyes are blue
and when she looks at me
i float in a warm lake
     feel my muscles go weak with want
          feel good
          feel safe

then—i never think of the blue
eyes that have glared at me
moved three stools away from me
in a bar
never hear my sisters rage
of syphilitic Black men as
guinea pigs
     rage of sterilized children
          watch them just stop in an
          intersection to scare the old
          white bitch
never feel my father turn
in his grave
never remember my mother
teaching me the yes sirs and ma’ams
to keep me alive
never hear my mother cry
Lord, what kind of child is this?
</p>
 

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>and when we go to a gay bar
and my people shun me because i crossed
the line
and her people look to see what’s
wrong with her
     what defect
     drove her to me

and when we walk the streets
of this city
     forget and touch
     or hold hands
         and the people
          stare, glare, frown, and taunt
               at those queers

i remember
     every word taught me
     every word said to me
     every deed done to me
          and then i hate
i look at my lover
andfor an instant
     doubt

then—i hold her hand tighter
     and i can hear my mother cry.
     Lord, what kind of child is this?</p>
