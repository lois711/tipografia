<h3></h3>
<p>Dressed in an old coat I lumber
Down a street in the East Village, time itself
</p>
<p>
Whistling up my ass and looking to punish me
For all the undone business I have walked away from,
</p>
<p>
And I think I might have stayed 
In that last tower by the ocean,
</p>
<p>
The one I built with my hands and furnished
Using funds which came to me at nightfall, in a windfall....
</p>
<p>
Just ahead of me, under the telephone wires
On this long lane of troubles, I notice a gathering
</p>
<p>
Of viciously insane criminals I’ll have to pass
Getting to the end of this long block in eternity.
</p>
<p>
There’s nothing between us. Good
I look so dangerous in this coat.</p>
