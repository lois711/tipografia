<p>after Morgan Parker, after Wu-Tang
<br>
in the morning I think about money
<br>
green horned lord of my waking
<br>
forest in which I stumbled toward no salvation
<br>
prison made of emerald & pennies
<br>
in my wallet I keep anxiety & a condom
<br>
I used to sell my body but now my blood spoiled
<br>
All my favorite songs tell me to get money
<br>
I’d rob a bank but I’m a poet
<br>
I’m so broke I’m a genius
<br>
If I was white, I’d take pictures of other pictures & sell them
<br>
I come from sharecroppers who come from slaves who do not come from kings
<br>
sometimes I pay the weed man before I pay the light bill
<br>
sometimes is a synonym for often
<br>
I just want a grant or a fellowship or a rich white husband & I’ll be straight
<br>
I feel most colored when I’m looking at my bank account
<br>
I feel most colored when I scream ball so hard motherfuckas wanna find me
<br>
I spent one summer stealing from ragstock
<br>
If I went to jail I’d live rent-free but there is no way to avoid making white people richer
<br>
 A prison is a plantation made of stone & steel
 <br>
Being locked up for selling drugs = Being locked up for trying to eat
<br>
a bald fade cost 20 bones now a days
<br>
what’s a blacker tax than blackness?
<br>
and poor?
<br>
here is where I say reparations.
<br>
here is where I say got 20 bucks I can borrow?
<br>
student loans are like slavery but not but with vacation days but not but police
<br>
I don’t know what it says about me when white institutions give me money
<br>
how much is the power ball this week?
<br>
I’mma print my own money and be my own god and live forever in a green frame
<br>
my grandmamma is great at saving money
<br>
before my grandfather passed he showed me where he hid his money & his gun
<br>
my aunt can’t hold on to a dollar, a job, her brain
<br>
I love how easy it is to be bad with money
<br>
 don’t ask me about my taxes
 <br>
the b in debt is a silent black boy trapped<br></p>
